# PreToolUse guard for review-pr skill.
#
# Forces a confirmation prompt before any Bash command that PUBLISHES to GitHub
# (posting PR/issue reviews or comments, merging, creating/editing PRs or
# releases, or writing via `gh api`). Read-only commands such as `gh pr view`,
# `gh pr diff`, `gh pr list`, and GET `gh api` calls pass straight through.
#
# This exists because the review-pr skill instructs the model to show a draft
# for human review before posting -- but a skill instruction can be skipped.
# This hook is enforced by the harness, so it cannot be.
